In some cases, however, the signature field becomes locked after you sign it. Sign in preview mode for document integrity When document integrity is critical for your signature workflow, you can enable View documents in Preview mode , and then sign the document. This feature analyzes the document for content that may alter the look and feel of the document and suppresses such content to allow you to view and sign the document in a static and secure state. By signing in preview mode, you ca n find if the document contains: Any dynamic content or external dependencies. Any constructs such as form fields, multimedia, or JavaScript that may affect its look and feel. After reviewing the report, you can contact the author of the document about the problems listed in the report. Certify a PDF Certifying a PDF means approving its contents and specifying what changes are allowed for the document to remain certified. For example, a government agency creates a form with signature fields and certifies it, allowing users to only change form fields and sign the document. Removing pages or adding comments will result in losing the certified status. A certifying signature can only be applied if the PDF has no other signatures. These signatures can be visible or invisible, and a blue ribbon icon in the Signatures panel confirms a valid certifying signature. Adding a certifying digital signature requires a digital ID. Timestamp a document Acrobat allows users to add a document timestamp to a PDF without n eeding an identity - based signature. To timestamp a PDF, a timestamp server is needed. See how to configure a timestamp server . A timestamp guarantees the authenticity and existence of a document at a specific time and complies with ETSI 102 778 PDF Advanced Electronic Signatures (PAdES) standard.
