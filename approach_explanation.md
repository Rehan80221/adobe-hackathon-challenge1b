# Approach Explanation: Challenge 1B Multi-Collection PDF Analysis

## Methodology Overview

Our solution implements a three-stage intelligent document analysis pipeline specifically optimized for persona-driven content extraction and ranking.

### Stage 1: Structured PDF Processing
We use **PyPDF2** combined with custom section detection patterns to extract text while preserving document structure. Our approach identifies section boundaries using multiple pattern-matching strategies:
- Numbered sections (1., 1.1, etc.)
- Chapter headings and major titles
- ALL CAPS headings and implicit heading detection
- Content-based importance scoring using keyword analysis

### Stage 2: Semantic Relevance Analysis
The core of our system leverages **sentence-transformers** with the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model (90MB) for semantic understanding. We enhance basic similarity scoring through:
- **Persona-specific keyword dictionaries** tailored for travel planners, HR professionals, food contractors, researchers, and analysts
- **Task-aware query enhancement** that combines persona context with job-to-be-done requirements
- **Multi-factor scoring** combining semantic similarity (50%), keyword relevance (30%), and structural importance (20%)

### Stage 3: Hierarchical Content Ranking
Our ranking system prioritizes content through:
- **Section-level analysis** identifying the most relevant document sections
- **Subsection extraction** that intelligently splits content into meaningful chunks
- **Importance weighting** based on document structure, content length, and semantic relevance

## Key Technical Decisions

**Model Selection**: We chose `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` because it provides excellent semantic understanding while staying well under the 1GB constraint at only 90MB.

**Processing Optimization**: We implement batched embedding generation, content length limits (2000 chars per section), and early filtering to ensure sub-60-second processing times.

**Persona Adaptation**: Rather than using generic embeddings, we dynamically enhance queries with persona-specific and task-specific keywords, significantly improving relevance accuracy.

**Content Chunking**: Our intelligent subsection extraction uses both paragraph boundaries and sentence splitting to create coherent, meaningful content chunks that maintain context.

## Performance Characteristics

- **Speed**: Optimized for <60s processing with content caching and batched operations
- **Accuracy**: Multi-factor scoring ensures high precision in section relevance ranking
- **Scalability**: Handles 3-15 documents efficiently with consistent performance
- **Robustness**: Comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms for varied PDF formats

This approach specifically targets the 60% section relevance scoring criteria by ensuring our ranking algorithm deeply understands both the user persona and their specific job requirements, while the 40% subsection relevance is achieved through intelligent content segmentation and context-aware extraction.
